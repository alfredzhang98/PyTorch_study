# Introduction

This learning repository is from the 《PyTorch深度学习实战》on the geekbang website.

# Structure

There are three main parts of this course:

1. 'Basic': Basic knowledge of PyTorch, including numpy basics, basic calculation components of PyTorch, how to use the Tensor.
2. 'Training': How to build and train neural networks with PyTorch, including autograd, nn module, optim module, and training process.
3. 'Application': Practical applications of PyTorch in various domains, including computer vision, LSTM motion prediction and etc.
